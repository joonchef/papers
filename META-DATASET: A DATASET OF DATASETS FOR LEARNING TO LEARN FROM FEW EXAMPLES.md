## Abstract
Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given only a
few examples. While a plethora of models have emerged to tackle it, we find the
procedure and datasets that are used to assess their progress lacking. To address
this limitation, we propose META-DATASET: a new benchmark for training and
evaluating models that is large-scale, consists of diverse datasets, and presents
more realistic tasks. We experiment with popular baselines and meta-learners
on META-DATASET, along with a competitive method that we propose. We
analyze performance as a function of various characteristics of test tasks and
examine the models’ ability to leverage diverse training sources for improving their
generalization. We also propose a new set of baselines for quantifying the benefit of
meta-learning in META-DATASET. Our extensive experimentation has uncovered
important research challenges and we hope to inspire work in these directions.
